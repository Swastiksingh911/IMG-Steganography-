# IMG-Steganography-
Image Steganography refers to the process of hiding data within an image file.  

With Image Steganography, our aim is embed a secrete message into an image and retrieve that secrete message from the image.  Our aim with this project is to make as minimal changes to the original image as possible, making the change invisible to the naked eye.  We propose achieving this objective through the alteration of the LSB or Least Significant Bit of pixels in the image, making the alteration as low as possible. 

The core area of the project revolves around the hiding of a secret message under an image file , The code offers interactive elements at the current stage.We plan to improve further in this by giving the flexibility of choosing any file of any dimension and hide our secret code in it .
